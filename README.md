# CryptoClustering
Repo for CryptoClustering challenge

This project is to show how using fewer features when clustering a dataset can lead to tighter clustering, and more accurate results.
Using fewer features reduces the noise.

celcius-degree-token is an example of one that would visually fall under one of the previous clusters, but after filtering the data to only what you need, it shows it's
true posistion, and how different it is from the other points.
